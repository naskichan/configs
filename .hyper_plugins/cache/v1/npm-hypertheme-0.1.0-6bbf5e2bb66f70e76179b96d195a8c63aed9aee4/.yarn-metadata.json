The theme should export an object with the same color fields that are specified in `~/.hyperterm.js`.\n\nThen add a `config.theme` field in your `~/.hyperterm.js` file. The value should match the name of the theme file (without the `.js` extension).\n\nSave your config file and your new theme will be loaded!\n",
